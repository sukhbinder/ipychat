## Features

- **Context-Aware**: Automatically uses relevant context from your IPython session
- **Rich Output**: Markdown-formatted responses with syntax highlighting
- **Multiple AI Models**: Supports GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini and local models using ollama.
- **Interactive Configuration**: Easy model switching and configuration through magic commands

## Installation

You can install `ipychat` using pip:

```python
$ pip install ipychat
```

## Usage

You can start the REPL by running the `ipychat` command:

```
$ ipychat
Welcome to ipychat! Use %ask to chat with gpt-4o.
You can change models using %models.

In [1]:
```

Alternatively, you can load the `ipychat` extension in an IPython session:

```
In [1]: %load_ext ipychat
```

You can then start asking the model any question using the `%ask` magic.

```
In [1]: %ask what can I do with the cities dataframe
```

You can change the current model using the `%models` magic.

```
In [1]: %models
```

## Configuration

Based on the model you want to use, either set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or both environment variables. You can also run `ipychat config` to configure `ipychat` interactively.

### Local models
To use local models using `ollama` ensure that your Ollama server is running and that you have pulled some models. You can use ollama list to check what is locally available.
